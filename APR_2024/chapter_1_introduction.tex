\section{Context and motivations}
 Modeling 
three-phase flow has important application in petroleum engineering,
and environmental science. Accurately capturing physical outcomes from fluids such as oil, gas, and water
in an underground reservoir is crucial for the oil and gas industry. The
following discussion and analysis of numerical solutions provide a robust model
to solve these coupled non-linear partial differential equations in a way that
accurately describes physical phenomenon we can observe.
\section{APR Outline}
This APR includes 4 chapters. Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of the model problem and equations on the 3-phase 3-component black oil model. Chapter 2 gives information and detail surrounding time discretization and a new stabilization method proof. Chapter 3 will give details surrounding space discretization. Chapter 4 will give convergence results for a test on manufactured solutions and simulation results on a 2-D domain. Finally, a conclusion including a summary of the
APR and details surrounding future work.
